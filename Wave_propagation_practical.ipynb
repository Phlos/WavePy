    "1. **Second**, you will simulate wave propagation within this setting and analyse what is happening. You will become familiar with the interplay between source-receiver configuration, the seismic wavefield and reflections.\n",
    "1. **Third**, you will learn about the relationships between seismic velocity, signal frequency and the ray approximation. For this, you will look at _Fresnel zones_ and compute so-called _sensitivity kernels_. You will look at how this sensitivity varies for different parts of the seismogram and analyse how they highlight different properties and/or parts of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, **you should be able to answer the following questions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the main assumptions of ray theory? And where does this assumption break down?\n",
    "* What do we mean by  'sensitivity kernels', and how do they relate to ray paths?\n",

    "* What is the influence of frequency on sensitivity to a model?\n",

Why is this kernel so much more messy than the P-wave kernel we looked at before? *Hint: go back to the seismogram where the measurement window is picked, and/or the wavefield simulation to see what happens around the time the S-wave reaches the receiver.*"

    "The reason we are so interested in the wave nature of seismic wave propagation is that it is a direct issue in seismology. Earthquakes don't send out sharp pulses -- their source-time functions are extended over time. This means that in reality, ray paths in the Earth do not exist either - instead our signals are sensitive to a blob of Earth that gets ever more complex depending on the Earth structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of seeing this as a limitation, **we can use the wave nature of seismic signals -- using waveform tomography**. Compared to 'classical' tomography, we do not measure specific arrival times and compare these to theoretically computed times, we compare entire seismograms against synthetic seismograms. In _waveform tomography_, we thus want to find an Earth model that fits our observed (entire) seismograms. Sensitivity kernels play a central role in achieving this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* By selecting windows that include arrivals that travelled along many different \"paths\" through the Earth, we can fill up our model domain with sensitivity. \n",
    "* Within each window, we compare our real and synthetic seismograms to each other to determine the \"misfit\", compute the adjoint source and from there calculate the sensitivity kernels.\n",
    "* Sensitivity kernels, in this context, are the _gradients_ of the misfit with respect to the model parameters. In other words, they tell you how each model parameter should be updated in order to better fit the data.\n",
    "* By doing this *iteratively* (compute misfit - compute gradients - update model - repeat), you can obtain an Earth model that reflects the full physics of seismic wave propagation, without needing any limiting assumptions."

If you want do waveform tomography on a large scale, with potentially hundreds of thousands of seismograms from hundreds of earthquakes, this will consume a lot of computational resources (and as a consequence, result in not insignificant greenhouse gas emissions). We therefore want to be sure that it's worth it. So is it? \n",
